This folder is organized as follows:

bin:      This sub-directory contains the command-line version of the 
          Panini compiler. 
          > panc: use this command to compile Panini programs on  
                  Unix-like systems.
          > panc.bat: use this command to compile Panini programs on  
                  Windows and derivatives.

                  Unix-like systems.
          > panini.bat: use this command to run Panini programs on 
                  Windows and derivatives.

examples: This sub-directory contains various examples of the usage of the 
          Panini language. 
          
          * HelloWorld.java: simplest illustrative example 
          
          * SignatureExample.java: illustrates signatures in Panini 
          
          * Pi.java: an example of using Panini features to implement 
                master-worker style program design that computes the value of
                Pi using the Monte Carlo simulation method.
                     
          * Pipeline.java: an example of a pipeline design
          
          * Philosophers.java: classic dining philosophers example in 
                Panini that illustrates access to shared resources 
                      
          * EchoServer.java: an example of using Panini features to 
                build implicitly-concurrent servers that uses a collection 
                of workers organized in a leader-follower style resource pool.
                     
          * EchoClient.java: client of the EchoServer.
          
          * Histogram.java: another example of master-worker style program that
                builds a histogram of ASCII character occurences in the 
                entire works of Shakespeare. 
                     
          * AddressBook: illustration of coarse-grained implicit concurrency
                in a larger application that given a name searches for that name 
                in five different kinds of address books.

licenses: This sub-directory contains licenses that apply to various parts 
          of the Panini compiler.     

Installing the Panini compiler.

To install the Panini compiler simply move the contents of this folder to 
a suitable location. In the rest of this document, we will refer to this 
location as $PANC_HOME.

- For unix-based systems, recommended locations are /usr/bin/panini, 
  /usr/local/bin/panini, or ~/bin/panini. 
- For Windows and derivative operating systems, recommended locations are 
  C:\Program Files\Panini or C:\Documents and Settings\User\Panini
 
Running examples.

To run examples change your current directory to $PANC_HOME, where 
$PANC_HOME stands for the location where you installed the Panini compiler 
distribution. The transcript below illustrates running some examples. 
Windows users would have to replace `/' with '\' in commands below,
e.g. "..\bin\panc" instead of "../bin/panc".

[panini] $ ls
README   bin      editors  examples lib      licenses
[panini] $ cd examples 
[examples] $ ../bin/panc HelloWorld.java 
[examples] $ ../bin/panini HelloWorld
Hello World!
[examples] $ ../bin/panc Pi.java
[examples] $ ../bin/panini Pi 8
Pi : 3.14184132
Time to compute Pi using 1.0E8 samples was:1112.0ms.
