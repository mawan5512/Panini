 * An example application to illustrate usage of capsules.
 * 
 * This example implements functionality for unified
 * search from one or more type of address books for
 * a user. A user may choose to add several address
 * books of specified types, e.g. an address book
 * stored as an XML file, CSV file, Excel spreadsheet,
 * relational database, or even third party services
 * such as Google contacts.
 * 
 * Once the address book is setup, it can be used to
 * search for addresses by providing the first name
 * and the last name of the person.

NOTE: the example depends on two files in the source package, 
AddressBook.csv and AddressBook.xml.  If a separate directory
is used for classes, these two file need to be copied into that 
directory (Eclipse does this automatically).
