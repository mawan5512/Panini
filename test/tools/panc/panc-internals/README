Tests which make assertions about the state of the compiler or various
ASTs in the compiler. Generally these tests will make use of the
'javax.lang.model.*' infrastructure for examining compiler state.

This directory is intended to serve as a 'source' directory for IDEs, such as
eclipse, and only contain valid java code.

Files with an '@test' tag should be on the same level as this README file.
Placing all the 'tests' in the default package/root of this source directory
simplifies getting the build path set correctly for jtreg.
