This folder is organized as follows:

examples: This sub-directory contains various examples of the usage of the 
          Panini language. Some of these examples may be under development
          so all of them may not compile or run as intended.
          
          If you are trying out the language, it would be best to look at 
          examples available with the Panini compiler distribution.  

licenses: This sub-directory contains licenses that apply to various parts 
          of the Panini compiler.     
                   
make:     This sub-directory contains the files necessary for building the
          Panini compiler from command-line.

makefiles: contains a template Makefile

src:      This subdirectory contains sources for Panini's front-end based
          on OpenJDK infrastructure. This is the actively maintained version of
          the Panini compiler.

test:     This subdirectory contains tests.

Building the Panini compiler.

The Panini compiler can be built from the command line with Ant.
The build file is make/build.xml, in conjunction with make/build.properties.
Some additional user-specific properties files are also read, to allow
you to customize selected properties as needed.

Individual tools within the workspace can also be built and worked on
with NetBeans, using the projects in the make/netbeans directory.

The Panini compiler can also be built from the command line with
GNU Make, although the Makefile is simply a wrapper around the Ant
build file. This is provided for systems (such as the full OpenJDK build)
that expect to be able to build this workspace with GNU Make.

System Requirements:
  Ant:      version 1.6.5 or later
  NetBeans: version 6.0 or later (optional)
  JDK:      currently version 1.5.0, although 1.6.0 is recommended
  OS:       any system supporting the above tools

  GNU Make: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
  NetBeans: http://www.netbeans.org/

Testing the Panini compiler.

The primary set of tests for the compiler is the compiler TCK. This
tests that the compiler performs according to the specifications in
JLS and JVMS.

In addition, there is a substantial collection of regression and unit
tests for all the tools in the test/ directory.
